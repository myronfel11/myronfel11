          Bahia Principe is a 5 star all inclusive resort that was a great place
          for just sitting back and relaxing. Great food from many places and a
          really clean and luxurious experience. They used this resort hopping
          trolley system, where you could visit their multiple different resorts
          with trolleys that arrived like busses with titles on them telling you
          which resort they're heading too. Each resort would have their own
          theme and something they're known for like adults only, or giant swim
          pool, or waterpark.

          This was my first time ever going to Mexico and it was so fun and
          exciting because I got to go there with my lovely girlfriend. It was
          also the first time both of us got to go on a plane together so it was
          very nerve racking, lots of emotions running their highs. We heard a
          saying "vacations can be a make it or break it for relationships" so
          that was scary. But we had so much fun! just being able to soak in the
          sun, relax, and eat good food was really an experience of a lifetime.
          It taught me that sometimes no matter how things are going, if it's
          good or bad, frustrating or stressful, you just need to take a step
          back and really just make the best out of the moment youre currently
          in and just live in the moment.

          Sunscape is a 3 star all inclusive resort that was well accomodating,
          considering they were able to book about 20 of us in at the same time
          with considerably close rooms. They had buffets for breakfast, lunch
          and dinner, and a few more restaurants with different themed dishes
          such as taco night, pasta night, or seafood night. Sunscape would hold
          plenty of fun events such as volleyball time, water polo time,
          trampoline time, and karaoke time. <br /><br />
          This was the first time I was able to go on a vacation with majority
          of my family. As we get older, it gets a lot harder to make time for
          each other with our schedules and lives ahead of us, but to us, it
          makes it that much more important to set time aside and be able to
          share some amazing memories. This year was super tough for me as I
          needed a 3.75 gpa to stay in school because of my previous situation.
          I almost did not attend the group vacation with all my cousins, aunts,
          uncles and direct family because I was so worried about needing this
          grade, but with a lot of planning, dedication and a stressful time. I
          was able to experience one of the most memorable moments of my life
          while achieving this grade I thought was unachievable.

          Mountain House by Basecamp Resorts was a very relaxing and easy to
          plan getaway. The resort had a wonderful staff that was very welcoming
          with plenty of places to visit around the resort. The stay had a sense
          of home and comfort making the adjustment feel almost non-existent.
          They had a hot tub, a restaurant, but the amenities were not the main
          attraction to it. The coziness and atmosphere is what made the
          staycation with its warm environment, fireplace and spacious,
          beautifully lit rooms.
          <br /><br />
          This was the first time my girlfriend and I went somewhere without
          anyone else and it was a real step towards growth, both as individuals
          and as a unity. We are both the youngest in our respective families so
          being able to do something ourselves and it go so smoothly, really
          gave a sense of independance and responsibility. The fact we were able
          to plan, adapt, and really enjoy our time together was a magical
          feeling and reminder how far and strong we have become to get this
          far.
